# Random Quote Machine

I build this project as a challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

Visual representation of this project can be found here: https://codepen.io/krlmazanik/full/XgQMYE/

## For this project I was using:
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
* Bootstrap.
* jQuery and jQuery-color libraries.

The project is based on forismatic api(https://forismatic.com/en/api/), which provides random quote.

Also, it was added Twitter integration, to share a quote on twitter.com

---

## The objectives of this project were:

* Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/.

* Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

* User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.

* User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
