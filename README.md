# Random Quote Machine

I build this project as a challenge on FreeCodeCamp.


Here I am trying to build A Random-Quote-Machine as a challenge for freecodecamp.com

The objectives are:

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.

User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
